**NOTE**
✅ Why cookies() is returning null

cookies() in Next.js (next/headers) **only reads cookies sent in the actual HTTP Cookie header, not from:

❌ Authorization → Bearer Token (Postman Auth tab)

❌ Headers → Authorization: Bearer xyz

You're currently sending the token as a Bearer Token in Postman, but your server is expecting a real browser cookie — these are two different things.
